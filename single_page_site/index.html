					<h2>Trend Following</h2>
					<p>
						Trend following is an investment or trading strategy which tries to take advantage of long, medium or short-term moves that seem to play out in various markets. 
						Traders who employ a trend following strategy do not aim to forecast or predict specific price levels; they simply jump on the trend (when they perceived that a 
						trend has established with their own peculiar reasons or rules) and ride it. These traders normally enter in the market after the trend "properly" establishes 
						itself, betting that the trend will persist for a long time, and for this reason they forego the initial turning point profit. A market "trend" is a tendency of 
						a financial market price to move in a particular direction over time. If there is a turn contrary to the trend, they exit and wait until the turn establishes itself 
						as a trend in the opposite direction. In case their rules signal an exit, the traders exit but re-enter when the trend re-establishes.

						<h2>AirBnB</h2>
						<p>
							Home rental company Airbnb is aiming to raise around $3 billion in its upcoming initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said on Friday, 
							taking advantage of the unexpectedly sharp recovery in its business after the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the travel industry. Airbnb will be one of the 
							largest and most anticipated U.S. stock market listings of 2020 which has already been a blockbuster year for IPOs.
							<br>
							<br>
							The companyâ€™s current plan is to make its filing publicly available in November after the U.S presidential election and is targeting an IPO some time in 
							December, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the plans are private.
